## My process
First, I created the structure in HTML. Then declarated the variables for colors, fonts and sizes. I't wasn't really necesary beacause it was a small challenge, but I wanted to buid it like it was a real project. I gived the body a display:grid to keep the footer in place and align the content. I used flexbox to place the content inside the card. Then just aplied the styles. Finally, I added a `@media` to make the card responsive.

I also used Photoshop to take some mesurements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
